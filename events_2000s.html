                    <h2> GEORGE W.BUSH WINS A CONTROVERSIAL ELECTION</h2>
                    <p>2000: George W.Bush wins the election for the 43rd President of the United States, 
                        against Democratic candidate Al Gore, after the Supreme Court of the United States stays a 
                        manual recount of votes ordered by the Supreme Court of Florida, in counties in Florida. 
                        The various recounts and ensuing court cases regarding the legitimacy of the recounts 
                        made this one of the most controversial elections in US history.</p>

                    <h2>U.S. BEGINS A GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR</h2>
                    <p> 2001 : Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks by Al-Qaeda, United States, 
                        under the presidency of George W. Bush, launches a military campaign with the 
                        aim to eliminate terrorism. The toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq in 2003 were manifestations of this policy.
                        The term and associated policies have since been harshly criticised for having been responsible 
                        for violations of human rights and not having the intended consequences.</p>
