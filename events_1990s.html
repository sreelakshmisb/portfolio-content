                <div class="grid-news">
                    <p class="grid-child1">1995: Football star OJ Simpson is acquitted of all murder charges in the highly publicized murder trial of his estranged wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. Dubbed the trial of the century, millions of viewers tune in to hear the verdict of the televised trial. The case was highly controversial, with citizens split in their opinion of Simpson's innocence, mostly along racial lines. Simpson was later sued by the victims' families in a civil case, which he lost.</p>

                <h2>U.S PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON IS IMPEACHED</h2>
                <div class="grid-news">
                    <p class="grid-child1">1998: U.S President Bill Clinton becomes the second president in U.S history to be impeached, following an affair with white house intern Monica Lewinsky. The affair which began in 1995 came to light through recorded conversations in which Lewinsky admitted to the encounters, to a co-worker. However, the impeachment did not lead to a conviction, as the prosecution failed to get the required support (from two-thirds of the members) of the senate.</p>
